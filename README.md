## Overview

Solovis' users are primarily "Institutional Investors". institutional investors are organizations that manage large pools of capital (money) on behalf of other people. This money is typically spread out into various "investments". The set of these investments can be thought of as a "portfolio".

At Solovis, we allow our users to analyze their portfolio in many different ways. Users can create customized categories for their investments and then analyze their portfolio according to those categories. For example, a user could track the geographic region of each of their investments. With that information they could then see how much of their portfolio is invested in Texas, Oregon, or the entire United States as a whole. However geographic region is only one possibility. Investments could be grouped and analyzed by sector, asset class, or something else entirely.

For the purpose of being generic, we will refer to these categories as "portfolio groupings" since they are a way that investments within a portfolio can be grouped. Portfolio groupings are hierarchical in nature. In the geographic region example above the United States would be the parent of Texas and Oregon since both Texas and Oregon are within the United States. Portfolio Groupings can be arbitrarily deep.
